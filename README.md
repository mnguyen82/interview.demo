# MARTA Real-time Train Arrivals. 
A simple single-page application that shows real-time train arrivals for all MARTA train stations:

## Features
+ A web interface shows real-time train arrivals for all MARTA train stations.
+ User can filter train arrivals by destination.
+ User can refresh the data via a button on the screen.

## Technical Approach
+ Developed as a Full-stack application
+ Front-end: Reactjs, webpack, babel. The React code will NOT run with its own proxy port. Instead, the back-end will be able to serve the front at its configurable port(by default 8080)
+ Back-end: Rest API service developed in Spring Boot. Also, there is a Spring MVC end-point that will render the index page of the react App.js main component
+ Basically, the back-end relies on Spring Boot and the Reactjs is responsible for the Front-end. I chose them because they are two well-known reliable open-source frameworks that help efficiently build an application with minimalistic programming efforts.
+ Paging is not provided, because:
	1. The Data is very limited
	2. This is a real-time data set, navigating page undermines the usefulness of the "real-time".
+ Auto refreshing data is not implemented, because it makes users uncomfortable to follow the train that they need when auto-refreshing happens. Instead, a refresh button provided on the UI so users can manually refresh at their convenient time. 

## Requirements
Following are the main frameworks/libraries used in the project.
+ [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
+ [Spring Boot 2.4.0] (https://spring.io/blog/2020/11/12/spring-boot-2-4-0-available-now)
+ [Gson] (https://github.com/google/gson)
+ [Apache HttpClient](https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-5.0.x/)
+ [Java 8]
+ [Maven] (https://maven.apache.org/)
+ Others

## Build/Run
Launch command-line program, then navigate to the root folder of the project, run:
	1. `mvn clean compile` // The command compiles all back-end code. Folders generated in this command will be used by the next commands
	2. `npm run-script watch` // This helps compile ALL of the JavaScript/Fron-end code and generate to a single file: target/classes/static/built/bundle.js
	3. `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true` // Packaging the whole generated compile code to an executable jar file
	4. Navigate to the target folder(generated by the above commands), run: `java -jar interview.demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
	Open browser hit the link: http://localhost:8080
